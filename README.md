# Personal Project


## Getting Started

This is a Next 13 project. You'll first need to install NPM dependencies, and then run a local development server. Here are the relevant terminal commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Run a development server:
npm run dev
```

To create new components, you can use this helper script. It saves you a bit of time, creating all the files and adding the standard code:

```bash
# Create a new component:
npm run new-component [TheNewComponentName]
```
